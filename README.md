This repository exists to support [my blog](https://asontu.github.io/). If you're here to see how some things on the blog work, you might find these links helpful:

*	[Introduction to GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
*	[Jekyll on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/)
*	Pagination done with the [Jekyll ootb pagination](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/)
*	Comments realized with [Staticman](https://staticman.net) hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) using [Travis Downs' guide](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html)<br>
	_(the docs on the staticman site are outdated, the ones on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman) are up-to-date but minimal)_
*	The theme is a heavily modified version of the [Hacker theme](https://pages-themes.github.io/hacker/) as it's one of the [supported themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/) on GitHub Pages. Background SVG and inspiration taken from the [Leaf](https://jekyll-themes.com/supun-io/jekyll-theme-leaf) theme, which itself is not supported on GitHub Pages
*	Pure CSS Light/dark mode toggle inspired by [Demilade Olaleye's codepen](https://codepen.io/demilad/pen/bZRjpb)
*	Pure CSS collapsible based on [Seb's article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-collapsible)
*	Tag-filtered overviews based on [Long Qian's article](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/#4-display-the-tags-of-a-post)<br>
	_(start at step 4 though, 1-3 are obvious or unnecessary)_
*	RSS-feed thanks to [Dzhavat Ushev's article](https://dzhavat.github.io/2020/01/19/adding-an-rss-feed-to-github-pages.html)
